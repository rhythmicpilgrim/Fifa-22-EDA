# Fifa-22-EDA
Using the FIFA dataset, I have conducted an analysis of the players in order to identify the top performers for recruitment to my team. This involves examining a range of factors such as player ratings, performance metrics, and other characteristics that may impact their suitability for the team. 

The FIFA 19 dataset comprises 18,207 records with 89 attributes, including player URL, short name, long name, positions played, overall rating, potential rating, value in euros, weekly wage in euros, age, height, weight, nationality, and club. The dataset covers both physical and skill-based characteristics, such as acceleration, sprint speed, dribbling, shooting, defending, and goalkeeping, among others. Additionally, it has information on each player's contract status, release clause, and international reputation.

In this project, I have acted as a scout hired by Real Madrid to discover the best possible players for the team. The potential users of this project and dataset include football clubs and scouts, analysts and journalists, fantasy football players, and researchers.

# Learnings
* Player reputation is strongly correlated with earnings: It appears that the more reputable a player is, the higher their earnings tend to be. However, there are some players with a reputation score of 5 who are being paid less than those with a reputation score of 4. This could be due to a number of factors, such as age, position, or overall performance.

* Age plays a role in player salaries: The data shows that the majority of high-paid players are between the ages of 25 and 35. This suggests that as players get older, their performance starts to decline, while younger players are still developing their skills and may not have proven themselves enough to command high salaries.

* Best goalkeepers for Real Madrid: The analysis indicates that Gianluigi Donnarumma is the most complete and well-rounded goalkeeper, with the best reflexes, handling, diving, and goal-kicking abilities. However, if he is not available, M. Maignan is also a strong option, ranking in the top 3 for all parameters except speed.

* Best attacking player for Real Madrid: Based on the data, E. Halland appears to be the top choice for Real Madrid's attacking needs, particularly in the area of finishing. While there are other strong attacking options available, they may be too expensive given the amount of money already being spent on top players.

* Messi vs. Ronaldo: Based on the analysis, L. Messi is currently the best active football player, followed by Levandowski and CR7. While this debate is always contentious and subjective, the data provides some empirical evidence to support these rankings.

# Conclusion 
In conclusion, this FIFA dataset analysis provides valuable insights for football clubs, scouts, analysts, journalists, fantasy football players, and researchers. The dataset includes a wealth of information on player attributes, salaries, and reputations, making it a valuable tool for scouting and analysis. The analysis highlights the importance of player reputation and age in determining salaries, as well as the top goalkeeping and attacking options for Real Madrid. Finally, the Messi vs. Ronaldo debate remains a hot topic, with the data showing Messi currently holding the edge over his rival.
